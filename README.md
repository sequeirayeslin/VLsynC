# VLsynC
Syncs VLC media player playback on multiple devices over the internet using mongodb. Can sync local video files as well as videos streamed over the internet. Any streaming link that works on VLC should work with this app. You need to install VLC (64 bit version), and have a mongodb server set up as mentioned in the comments of the .py files for this to work.

I had an idea for a login system that would make this a lot more user friendly. Will work on it if I get time.

PS: Just figured out how readme files work on github, will update this readme if I get time.
